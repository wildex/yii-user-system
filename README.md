Flexperto - Frontend Application Test
=====================================

THE TASK
--------------

Your task is to build an User-CRUD. You will find an allready prepared User model in the common tier,
including an authentication life-cycle (sign-up/sign-in/password-reset). What we expect:


1.  add an Avatar to Users
2.  add a mobile number to Users
3.  build a profile for registered Users (including regular show, editing and canceling the account)


You should focus on the views. If you feel the need of model-side or controller-side code, feel free to write it.
But your main objective should be to get your HTML to the Browser :-) You can use whatever IDE / component / technology 
you would like to, as long as this application stays the HTML-generating, server-side component. Keep in mind
that your code will have to run in our Apaches. An addition to this file for special setup instructions,
such for example bower and stuff, would be wise if needed :-)


### The Hook


We realy want you to show us your strengths. We tried, but we could not come up with a strict task
that both seemed fair but also challenging for your unique mindsets. Thats why we decided to design
this task in a very open ended manner.


This means that we guive you a guideline for 5 hours to solve the general task. How much time to actualy spend
is totaly up to you. It can be less, twice or even ten times 5 hours. But keep in mind that we will !not grant you a bonus!
based on the hours you did spend.


### What to do with the time


Well first of all you should try to deliver the key task. But if you feel that one or several items of the
key task are for example generaly outdated and bad practice, you can note this at the end of this section of the README,
just skip it and get the task done in less than 5 hours. If you feel that there should be more to it, or you want to show
us some niffty skills, or js libraries, or whatever - feel free to raise your time budget. You get the idea, right?
Get the task done - in a way that you feel comfortable with.


When you are finished, please honestly state how much time you did spend. If you feel the need, you can also
state specific things you focused on:


This solution took me ____ hours.

I added/skipped the follwing micro-tasks (because of ... ):

APPLICATION INTRODUCTION
------------------------ 

This Application is based on the [Yii 2 Advanced Application Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced).

Yii 2 Advanced Application Template is a skeleton Yii 2 application best for
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers.

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which
is a separate Yii application.

The template is designed to work in a team development environment. It supports
deploying the application in different environments.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this application template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `advanced` that is directly under the Web root.

Then follow the instructions given in "GETTING STARTED".


### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install the application using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:1.0.0"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced advanced
~~~


GETTING STARTED
---------------

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1. Run command `init` to initialize the application with a specific environment.
2. Create a new database and adjust the `components['db']` configuration in `common/config/main-local.php` accordingly.
3. Apply migrations with console command `yii migrate`. This will create tables needed for the application to work.
4. Set document roots of your Web server:

- for frontend `/path/to/yii-application/frontend/web/` and using the URL `http://frontend/`
- for backend `/path/to/yii-application/backend/web/` and using the URL `http://backend/`

To login into the application, you need to first sign up, with any of your email address, username and password.
Then, you can login into the application with same email address and password at any time.
